# Weather ETL Project

A Python-based ETL pipeline for collecting, processing, and storing weather data in a PostgreSQL database using Docker. Designed as a portfolio project to demonstrate integration of APIs, databases, and containerized workflows.

**Data Source**

The project consumes data from the **OpenWeatherMap API** ([https://openweathermap.org/api](https://openweathermap.org/api)), which provides real-time weather information, including:

- Temperature & feels-like temperature  
- Humidity  
- Weather conditions (e.g., clear, cloudy, rain)  
- City coordinates (latitude & longitude)

The ETL currently retrieves data for a predefined list of cities, with potential to expand globally.
